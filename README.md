# Ping Pong Score Keeper

Welcome to the Ping Pong Score Keeper project! This is a simple web application built using HTML, JavaScript, and the Bulma CSS framework. The purpose of this project is to provide a minimalistic tool for keeping track of scores in a ping pong game. Users can select the score limit for the game, increment the score for each player, and reset the game for a new round.

## Features

- **Score Selection:** Users can choose the score limit for the game from predefined options such as 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11.
- **Score Tracking:** Players can increment their scores individually.
- **Game End:** Once a player reaches the selected score limit, the game ends automatically, and the winner's score turns red while the loser's score turns green.
- **Reset Functionality:** Users can reset the game at any point to start a new round.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web application.
- **JavaScript:** Handles the dynamic behavior and interactivity of the score keeper.
- **Bulma:** A modern CSS framework for styling the application, providing a clean and responsive design.
